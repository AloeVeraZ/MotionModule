# Autonomous Driver

This separate program installs in `robots/autonomous/Autonomous Driver/`. Select it in
Driver Station's Autonomous picker, then press Enable. It turns left to 90°,
180°, 270° and 360° from the heading at Enable, settling at each stop. It uses
the Pi-connected MPU6500 gyroscope and the same four motor channels as the
Mecanum teleop program. It reads the always-running `module.imu`; it does not
configure or create a sensor. Switching from teleop keeps the same reader and
calibration. It works with both the regular MotionModule and
MotionModule Mini. The bundled code is for four-wheel mecanum robots; it does
not move if the IMU is unavailable.

If startup calibration is still finishing at Enable, the routine waits while
stopped for up to five seconds. It stops with an explanation if heading is
still unavailable, and Disable interrupts the wait immediately.

The turn plan is in `autonomous.py`. Disable stops all outputs immediately.
Keep the robot off the ground for the first powered check.
